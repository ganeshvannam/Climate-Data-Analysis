# Climate Data Analysis Project

## Overview
This project aims to analyze climate data using Python's Pandas library. The dataset used for analysis is sourced from [Berkeley Earth](http://berkeleyearth.lbl.gov/auto/Global/Complete_TAVG_daily.txt). The objective of the analysis is to gain insights into temperature anomalies over time.

## Project Setup
- **Python Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Main Script**: `climate_analysis.py`
- **Data Loading**: The data is fetched from the provided URL using the `p1_q1a` function.
- **Data Manipulation**: Columns are renamed and adjusted for appropriate data types. New columns are added to facilitate analysis.

## Tasks Completed
1. **Data Loading and Understanding:**
    - Loaded the dataset from the provided URL.
    - Explored the data format and descriptions.

2. **Data Manipulation:**
    - Renamed columns and adjusted data types as necessary.
    - Added new columns to enhance analysis.

3. **Statistical Analysis:**
    - Calculated mean anomaly and mean temperature by year and month.
    - Generated trends over time and visualized anomalies.

4. **Visualization:**
    - Created plots to visualize mean temperature and anomalies over time.
    - Produced a histogram to examine the distribution of anomaly data.

## Files Included
- `climate_analysis.ipynb`: Main script containing data loading, manipulation, analysis, and visualization.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project and setup instructions.

## Usage
1. Ensure Python and required libraries are installed.
2. Clone or download the project repository.
3. Run the `climate_analysis.py` script to execute the analysis.
4. Review the generated plots and analysis results.
